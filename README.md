## Hi, I’m Ramalingam 👋

Pre-final year Robotics Engineering student (with a minor in Full Stack Development), building reasoning-first learning systems and full-stack projects.

### What I’m working on
- **LGC Concept AI** — a thinking-first programming learning system
- **Rising ARC26** — a structured, discipline-driven learning journey

### How I learn & build
- Focus on understanding execution flow and core concepts
- Prefer reasoning over memorization
- Use AI as a validation tool, not a shortcut

### Current focus
- Java and full-stack fundamentals (frontend and cloud)
- Writing clearer code through structured learning
